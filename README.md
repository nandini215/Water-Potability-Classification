# Water-Potability

This project develops a robust machine learning model for predicting water potability by analyzing key water quality parameters, including pH, hardness, chloramine levels, sulfate concentration, conductivity, and turbidity. Leveraging a detailed dataset, we performed data preprocessing by imputing missing values with mean substitution to ensure high data quality. Various algorithms—Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors—were evaluated for performance, with Random Forest achieving the best accuracy at 66% in predicting potability. The project also features a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter, where users can input water parameters and instantly receive predictions on potability status. To facilitate easy deployment, the model is serialized as a pickle file, enabling seamless integration into practical applications like water quality testing systems. Future improvements include optimizing model accuracy and exploring additional features, ensuring a scalable and impactful solution to assess water safety effectively.
